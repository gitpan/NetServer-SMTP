README for NetServer::SMTP


NetServer::SMTP is a perl module that implements a minimal SMTP server
as perl RFC 821.

<WARNING>
   First alpha release -- work in progress!
   Don't try to use this for anything mission-critical.
   Found a bug? Let me know!
</WARNING>

NetServer::SMTP requires:

* Perl 5.004 or later
* The following modules:
  -- IO::Socket (part of the standard distribution, or available from
     CPAN)
  -- NetServer::Generic
  -- Mail::Internet (and related Mail-Utils)
  -- Data::Dumper
  -- FreezeThaw

One example is included:

  leafmail -- a simple mailserver that accepts connections and queues
              incoming mail for delivery via a smarthost. (Local
              delivery is not supported -- as yet).

To install NetServer::SMTP, follow the usual Perl module installation
practice, viz (probably as root):

  cd SMTP
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install
